# Hover Functionality Test

## Changes Made to Fix Hover Issues:

### 1. **Improved JavaScript Hover Functions**
- Created `handleBrandHover(isHovering)` function that properly targets all brand elements
- Created `handleNavLinkHover(linkElement, isHovering)` function for navigation links
- Uses document.querySelector to find elements more reliably

### 2. **Fixed Event Propagation Issues**
- Added `pointer-events: none` to child elements to prevent event conflicts
- Set `pointer-events: auto` on parent elements to ensure proper hover detection
- Removed individual hover events from child elements (icons and spans)

### 3. **Updated CSS for Better Hover Support**
- Enhanced `.custom-nav-link` and `.brand-with-icon` with proper pointer events
- Maintained the darker golden color `#D4AF37` for all hover states

## How It Works Now:

### Brand Hover:
- Hover over "TRAVEL PLANNER" brand triggers `handleBrandHover(true)`
- Changes color of: brand link, plane icon, and text to `#D4AF37`
- Mouse leave triggers `handleBrandHover(false)` to reset to white

### Navigation Links Hover:
- Hover over any nav link triggers `handleNavLinkHover(element, true)`
- Changes color of: link, icon, and text to `#D4AF37`
- Mouse leave triggers `handleNavLinkHover(element, false)` to reset to white

## Testing Instructions:
1. Open http://localhost:5174 in your browser
2. Hover over the "TRAVEL PLANNER" brand - should turn golden
3. Hover over each navigation item (Home, My Bookings, Contact, Login)
4. All elements should smoothly transition to the darker golden color (#D4AF37)
5. Moving the mouse away should return elements to white

## Key Improvements:
- ✅ More reliable hover detection
- ✅ Consistent color changes across all elements
- ✅ Smooth transitions without flickering
- ✅ Proper event handling without conflicts
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile devices
